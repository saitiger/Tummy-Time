1) Identified bottlenecks in the code for both memory and runtime.
2) Vectorized Operations to reduce time to process files
3) Refactored Code to remove unnecessary columns and identify invalid and empty rows 
4) Made a jupyter notebook that can be run locally on lab computer with no access to VS Code which made it not possible to run the web app.
