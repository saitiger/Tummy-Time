# Future Work 
- 1. Deep Learning Model {**__Halted for now__**}

      a. Working on a model for posture detection in infants, automating the manual work currently done using Datavyu
      
      b. Deployed initial model for posture detection. Received feedback on detection
     
      c. Prototyping on the new fine-tuned version; the previous model incorrectly classifies some classes more than others
     
- 2. Q&A Chatbot :

     a. Working on a pandas agent for interacting with the dataset for Ad-hoc analysis
     
     b. The current version does good descriptive statistics and basic questions but hallucinates sometimes
     
- 3. Denoising Data :
        Researching Low Pass Filter designs and experimenting with thresholds for non-wear time.
