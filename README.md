**Current Work :**
- Created a Streamlit App to automate populating Excel files using raw data from the sensor.
- Visualized and performed preliminary analysis 
- Performed Analysis on Sensor data which aided in finding bugs.
- The bug meant that the sensor was sometimes incorrectly detecting posture or unable to detect any posture at all in infants 

**Updates**
- Modified the code to assign the Overall Class correctly.
- Researched on vectorizing operations and identifying bottlenecks to optimize code for large files
- Optimized code.
- Encountered incorrect encoding,mixed datatypes and kernel dying issues.
- Handled the bugs. Started preprocessing the videos for posture detection
- Added a jupter notebook file that can be run locally on lab computers where running the web app is not possible
- Added input functions for easy navigation in the jupyter notebook
- Refactored functions. Tested code for files with 10M+ rows.
- Updated script to handle large files on streamlit app, added config file.

**Future Work:**
- Working on a deep learning model to correctly detect the posture of infants, thereby reducing manual work and labeling the dataset using Datavyu.
