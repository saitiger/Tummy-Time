**Current Work :**
- Created a Streamlit App to automate populating Excel files using raw data from the sensor.
- Visualized and performed preliminary analysis 
- Performed Analysis on Sensor data which aided in finding bugs.
- The bug meant that the sensor was sometimes incorrectly detecting posture or unable to detect any posture at all in infants 
- Updated the code to correctly assign the Overall Class.

**Future Work:**
- Working on a deep learning model to correctly detect the posture of infants, thereby reducing manual work and labeling the dataset using Datavyu.
